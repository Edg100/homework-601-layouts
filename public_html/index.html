    <h1>Types of Cloud Technologies</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Private Clouds</li>
        <ul>

            <li>Private clouds are loosely defined as cloud environments solely dedicated to a single end user or group,
                where the environment usually runs behind that user or group's firewall.</li>
            <li>All clouds become private clouds when the underlying IT infrastructure is dedicated
                to a single customer with completely isolated access.</li>
            <li>Customers create and use a private cloud that's deployed, configured, and managed by a third-party vendor.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Public Clouds</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Public clouds are cloud environments typically created from IT infrastructure not owned by the end user.</li>
            <li>Some of the largest public cloud providers include Alibaba Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, IBM Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.</li>
            <li>Traditional public clouds always ran off-premises, but today's public cloud providers have started offering cloud services on clients’ on-premise data centers. </li>
            <li>All clouds become public clouds when the environments are partitioned and redistributed to multiple tenants</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Hybrid Cloud</li>
        <ul>
            <li>A hybrid cloud is a seemingly single IT environment created from multiple environments connected
                through local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), virtual private networks (VPNs), and/or APIs.</li>
            <li>The characteristics of hybrid clouds are complex and the requirements can differ, depending on whom you ask. For example, a hybrid cloud may need to include:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>At least 1 private cloud and at least 1 public cloud </li>
                    <li>Two or more private clouds</li>
                    <li>Two or more public clouds</li>
                    <li>A bare-metal or virtual environment connected to at least 1 public cloud or private cloud</li>
                </ol>

        </ul>
        <li>Multiclouds</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Multiclouds are a cloud approach made up of more than 1 cloud service, from more than 1 cloud vendor—public or private.</li>
            <li>All hybrid clouds are multiclouds, but not all multiclouds are hybrid clouds.</li>
            <li>Multiclouds become hybrid clouds when multiple clouds are connected by some form of integration or orchestration.</li>
        </ul>

    </ul>

    <h2>Cloud Services</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cloud services are infrastructure, platforms, or software that are hosted by third-party providers and
            made available to users through the internet. Click here for more details <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-computing/public-cloud-vs-private-cloud-and-hybrid-cloud">RedHat </a> </li>
        <li>Some well-known cloud service providers</li>
        <ol>
            <li>AWS is a cloud service provider:</li>
